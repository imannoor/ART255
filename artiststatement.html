<div class="paragraph">  
<p>In my art, I strive to be authentic, colorful, and abstract. 
I choose to be authentic because I make art for myself. I hope that other people enjoy it; however, I do not keep that as an end goal in mind. Instead, as cheesy as it sounds, I do what makes me happy. I want my art to be colorful because I want it to reflect my life. I paint things I love, and I paint with colours I love. One of those is the colour pink. In all shades. This is evident in a lot of my work with pink being an overwhelming theme between some of my works. Strangely enough, I was not even aware of this connection, as some of the works that are mainly pink date years away from my most recent “pink” work. 
I make my work abstract because I do not take my art too seriously, and I enjoy making art that may not have a clear meaning and direction. </p>
          
<p>In my art, I love working with all medians. Water colour, oil pastels, digital art, acrylic paints and ceramics. I use any median that interests me as I enjoy trying new things. Another art piece I love creating are collages. I love making them into mixed medias by including fabrics, and other objects like gems and stones to give it more depth and texture. </p>
          
<p> Although art is not my major, nor my main focus in my life I enjoy it a lot. I even use it within my major of linguistics where I try to use art to facilitate English second language learning. That is why I love art so much. It is integral part of so many different part areas of our lives and I hope that this book inspires you to make art, even if you do not think you are an Artist.
